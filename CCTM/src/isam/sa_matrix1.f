!  The Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) system software is in     !
!  continuous development by various groups and is based on information  !
!  from these groups: Federal Government employees, contractors working  !
!  within a United States Government contract, and non-Federal sources   !
!  including research institutions.  These groups give the Government    !
!  permission to use, prepare derivative works of, and distribute copies !
!  of their work in the CMAQ system to the public and to permit others   !
!  to do so.  The United States Environmental Protection Agency          !
!  therefore grants similar permission to use the CMAQ system software,  !
!  but users are requested to provide copies of derivative works or      !
!  products designed to operate in the CMAQ system to the United States  !
!  Government without restrictions as to use by others.  Software        !

      SUBROUTINE SA_MATRIX1 ( KL, A, B, E, D, X )

C Rather than solving the ACM2 banded tridiagonal matrix using LU decomposition,
C it is much faster to split the solution into the ACM1 convective solver followed
C by the tridiagonal solver
C MATRIX1 is the ACM1 solver. When the PBL is convective, this solver is called
C followed by TRI. If not convective, only TRI is called.

C-- ACM1 Matrix is in this form (there is no subdiagonal:
C   B1 E2                     <- note E2 (flux from layer above), not E1
C   A2 B2 E3
C   A3    B3 E4
C   A4       B4 E5
C   A5          B5 E6
C   A6             B6
